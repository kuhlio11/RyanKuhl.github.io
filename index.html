            <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
        <p>Currently pursuing an Associate Degree in Computer Science with a focus on IT Software Development at Chippewa Valley Technical College, I have gained comprehensive knowledge in areas such as Data Analysis, Software Engineering, Operating Systems, and Algorithms. Additionally, my Professional Certificate in Meta iOS Software Development from Coursera has equipped me with practical skills in creating user interfaces, front-end development, and mobile app development using technologies like JavaScript, SwiftUI, React, and React Native.</p>

        <p>My professional journey has provided me with diverse experiences, including serving as an IT Service Desk technician at Chippewa Valley Technical College, where I provided technical assistance to faculty and students, managed device deployment, and resolved networking issues. Prior to this, my role as a Design Educator at the Canadian International School in Singapore allowed me to instruct students in design tools like Figma and Adobe Photoshop, leading collaborative projects with a focus on client expectations and technical specifications.</p>   
        
        <p>Furthermore, my background in education spans over a decade, during which I held various leadership positions such as Design Team Leader and Design, Math, & Science Educator at international schools in Singapore and South Korea. In these roles, I developed and implemented engaging lesson plans, fostered STEM education initiatives, and cultivated positive classroom environments conducive to learning.</p>     
        
        <p>Beyond my professional experiences, I have undertaken several developer and design projects, including developing a sales generating website for a local business using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, an iOS mobile app for a restaurant using SwiftUI, and designing product labels using Figma. These projects have honed my technical skills in front-end development, user interface design, and mobile development, while also enhancing my ability to work collaboratively and manage project timelines effectively.</p>
